				<h2>Big Time Rush</h2>
				<p>
					Hah, yea<br>
					B T R, huh huh<br>
					Here I am<br>
					There you are<br>
					Why does it seem so far<br>
					Next to you is where I should be (where I wanna be)<br>
					Something I<br>
					Want so bad<br>
					Know what's inside your head<br>
					Maybe I could see what you see (tell me what you see)<br>
					<br>
					Gotta keep on believing<br>
					That everything takes time<br>
					I'll make up any reason<br>
					To make you mine<br>
					If you're staying or leaving<br>
					I'll follow your lead<br>
					So why keep pretending<br>
					Open your eyes<br>
					I can be what you need<br>
					<br>
					Any kind of guy you want, girl<br>
					That's the guy I'll be<br>
					Turn myself upside down (yes I will, yes I will)<br>
					Any kind of guy you want, girl<br>
					You know I'll agree<br>
					Turn your whole world around (yes I will, yes I will)<br>
					<br>
					Any kind, any kind<br>
					Any kind of guy you want<br>
					You decide<br>
					Change your mind<br>
					I will be there<br>
					Won't you try<br>
					One more try<br>
					Be my any kind of girl<br>
					You decide<br>
					It's alright<br>
					I will be there<br>
					<br>
					You seem so hard to know<br>
					Say goodbye, say hello<br>
					Then you say that it's time to go (now it's time to go)<br>
					Changing my point of view<br>
					Everyday something new<br>
					Anything to get next to you (gonna get to you)<br>
					<br>
					Gotta keep on believing<br>
					That everything takes time<br>
					I'll make up any reason<br>
					To make you mine<br>

					I will be there<br>
					<br>
					Let me know if I'm getting through<br>
					Making you understand<br>
					If it's wrong I'll try something new (try something
					New)<br>
					Don't look away<br>
					Cause I'm here to stay<br>
					If it's a game<br>
					Then I'm gonna play<br>
					<br>
